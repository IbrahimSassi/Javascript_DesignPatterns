# Javascript Design Patterns
> This repo will show you tried and true design patterns to help structure and organize your code to make your JavaScript code more readable and maintainable

## 1. Creational Design patterns
> Used to create new objects, adapting creation to the situation


#### ⋅⋅* Constructor Pattern
> Use to create new objects with their own object scope

#### ⋅⋅* Module Pattern
> Simple way to encapsulate methods

#### ⋅⋅* Factory Pattern
> Used to simplify object creation

#### ⋅⋅* Singleton Pattern
> Used to restrict an object to one instance of that object across the application


## 2. Structural Design patterns
> Concerned with how objects are made up and simplify relationships between objects

#### ⋅⋅* Decorator Pattern
> Used to add new functionality to an existing object, without being obtrusive

#### ⋅⋅* Facade Pattern
> Used to provide a simplified interface to a complicated system

#### ⋅⋅* Flyweight Pattern
> Conserves memory by sharing portions of an object between objects


## 3. Behavioral Design patterns
> Concerned with the assignment of responsibilities between objects and how they communicate

#### ⋅⋅* Observer Pattern
> Allows a collection of objects to watch an object and be notified of changes

#### ⋅⋅* Mediator Pattern
> Controls communication between objects so neither object has to be coupled to the others

#### ⋅⋅* Command Pattern
> Encapsulates the calling of a method as an object
